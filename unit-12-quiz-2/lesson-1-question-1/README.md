# Question 1

Write the basic structure for the `Student` class, which receives the following
instance attributes: `first_name`, `last_name`, `age`, `country` (default "United States").

Implement a `@property` called `full_name` that concatenates and returns the
`first_name` and `last_name` separating them with a white space.
