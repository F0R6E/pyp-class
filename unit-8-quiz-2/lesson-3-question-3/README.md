# Question 3

Augment the `Student` class from the previous assignment, and a new `compatriot(s1, s2)`
static method, that receives two student instances as argument and returns `True` if
they are both from the same country, or `False` otherwise.

Remember to make this new method a `staticmethod` in the class.
